## Dependecies 🗄️
react: 18.2.0 - Open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI) in web applications based on components.
React was the main topic of this project because it is the course im studying.

react-dom: 18.2.0 - The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app and as an escape hatch to get outside the React model if you need to.

react-icons: 4.7.1 - Small library that helps you add icons (from all different icon libraries) to your React apps. It delivers the icons to your app as components so they're easier to work with, and it lets you style them so they're consistent with the overall style of your app

react-router-dom: 6.8.0 - Enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. Unlike the traditional routing architecture in which the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app, React Router DOM facilitates component-based routing according to the needs of the app and platform.

vite: 4.0.0 - Vite js is a development tool that comes with a dev server and is used for modern web applications. 
I used React+Vite as follows: npm create vite@latest iFonesUp

tailwindcss: 3.2.4 - A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. 
It was used for the first time to try something different than bootsrap.

firebase: 9.17.1 - Firebase is a set of hosting services for any type of application. It offers NoSQL and real-time hosting of databases, content, social authentication, and notifications, or services, such as a real-time communication server.
Was used to upload the products to the web and then to retrieve them and store the customer´s order.
